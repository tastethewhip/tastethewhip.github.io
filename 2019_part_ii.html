beaten by 3 lengths - under a hands and heels ride. Jockey said his instructions were to keep the filly straight and balanced over the undulating ground - and to keep the filly comfortable and travelling throughout. Jockey added that he had been able to carry out the instructions - as the filly had jumped to a nice position and although wasn't travelling in the early stages - he was able to ask for an effort approximately 1 \u00bd furlongs out. Trainer's rep stated that having spoken to the trainer by telephone - the trainer felt the ride was overly sympathetic.
