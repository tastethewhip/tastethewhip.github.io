Today he added that his mount was keen going to the start and as a result was dropped in towards the rear to get him to switch off. On reviewing the video of the race he explained that his mount had jumped very well - met with some interference at the first hurdle in the straight on the first circuit - got keen and kept being taken back - was hanging out in the straight and was not ridden forcibly as he was minding him with a view to get him to finish his race and benefit from todays run. On further questioning - the rider admitted that he could possibly have finished a couple of places closer.Trainer - stated that he instructed the rider to ride his charge in mid division - get him settled and to do his best as he had tired the last day when ridden handy. He expressed that he had four runners in this race but on viewing the video he felt that the jockey was further back in the field of runners than he had wished and that he could have finished closer; vet stated that the gelding was post race normal)(op 66/1 tchd 80/1)"],["2022-01-22","Navan (IRE)","803447","1:05","Graigs Lane Maiden Hurdle (Div II)","Hurdle","","","","5yo+","","2m4f","Yielding","19","3","11","","72.75","2.75","Champagne Storm (IRE)","8","G","165","","5:28.65","125/1","Richard Deegan","T J OMara","","\u2013","56","3","Flemensfirth (USA)","Blue Gale (IRE)","Be My Native","Miss R Hickey","Midfield -
