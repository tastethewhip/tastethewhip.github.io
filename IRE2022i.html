On further questioning - the rider admitted that he could possibly have finished a couple of places closer.Trainer - stated that he instructed the rider to ride his charge in mid division - get him settled and to do his best as he had tired the last day when ridden handy.

Jockey stated that he recently rode the gelding at Naas where he ran very free. Today he was instructed to drop the gelding out - switch him off - get him to settle - creep into the race at a later stage and to do his best. On viewing the video recording of the race he explained that he complied with his riding instructions but felt that the gelding only stayed on past tired horses from the third last hurdle and could not have finished any closer. Jockey further added that he reported to the trainer post race that his mount had whinnied after passing the finish line. Trainer confirmed the riding instructions and expressed his satisfaction with the manner that they were carried out but felt that the rider should have pushed the gelding out harder from the second last hurdle.

Evidence was heard from the jockey and trainer concerned. The jockey stated that his instructions were to drop his mount out as it can be very keen at home - to get it jumping and to do the best he could. He said his mount ran very green throughout - missed the first hurdle - lost ground when impeded by fallers at different stages in the race and hung off the home bend. The trainer confirmed the instructions given and expressed his satisfaction with the ride. He said his charge was having its first run on the track and can be a very keen individual. He accepted that the jockey could have been seen to make more of an effort - but concluded by confirming his satisfaction with the ride. The Stewards also received a report from the vet - who stated that the filly was found to have slight bilateral nasal discharge and noted a fresh wound on an old wound on the right hind coronet. Stewards suspended the filly for a period of 42 days.)"],["2022-02-13","Punchestown (IRE)","804729","3:40","Hollywoodbets Now Streaming UK & Irish Racing Maiden Hurdle","Hurdle","","","","4yo+","","2m4f","Heavy","20","17","10","","79.75","19","Cassarina Gold (IRE)","5","M","11-5","t","5:49.15","150/1","Peter Carberry","Matthew J Smith","","\u2013","31","\u2013","Notnowcato (GB)","Got Options (IRE)","Kings Theatre","R Sherlock","Towards rear -
