to take gelding quietly down to the start and if they jumped well to potentially make the running; however - given the speed on paper in the race - ideally find cover and sit just behind the leaders; he said gelding jumped very awkwardly from the stalls and lost several lengths - a fact that he had reported at scales - and thereafter he was focused on getting gelding balanced and giving him the opportunity to travel into the race and as a consequence lost some additional ground in the first half of the race; trainer confirmed the instructions and explained that in his opinion the gelding had been upset by a horse in the adjacent stall being unruly during the loading process and then forfeited a significant amount of ground through jumping awkwardly and becoming badly unbalanced; trainer further added that gelding can be a difficult ride with a high-head carriage and a tendency to race freely and for those reasons - is not the type of horse you can chase along through the early
