this being a recurrence of similar behaviour during his last run at Sligo on the 15th September. The jockey informed the Stewards that his mount had leaned out off the bend past the stands and reacted when another runner made contact with his hind quarters by kicking out violently. The trainer accepted that her charge had reacted in a similar manner at the bend past the stands both at Sligo and today. She described her charge as being a thin skinned and cold backed horse but his temperament overall was very good. She further suggested to the Stewards that she would try different training methods and review the tactics being used up to today. Having considered the matter and in view of the case put forward by the trainer - the Stewards advised her that any recurrence of a similar behaviour could render her charge liable for a suspension under Rule 14 (iii))(op 12/1 tchd 16/1)"],["2021-09-30","Clonmel (IRE)","794473","2:50","Clonmel Handicap Hurdle (Div II)","Hurdle","","","80-95","4yo+","","2m4f","Good To Yielding","16","7","PU","","-","-","Kabin Fever Too (IRE)","5","M","162","","-","80/1","Conor McNamara","Gavin Cromwell","","86","\u2013","\u2013","Leading Light (IRE)","Milanella (IRE)","Milan","Kabin Racing Syndicate","Always towards rear -
