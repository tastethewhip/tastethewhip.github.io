beaten by 7 1/2 lengths. Jockey stated that his instructions were to sit where the gelding would be most relaxed - get him switched off and let him finish off the race well as the gelding had run very keen in its previous races. After getting the gelding both cover and settled early - the jockey began to ask him for an effort approximately 2 1/2f out but stated that it took until the final 1 1/2f for the gelding to get organised and in his opinion the gelding only stayed on passing tiring horses inside the final furlong - with the winner still going away from him at the line. Trainer's rep confirmed the instructions and stated that he was satisfied that the ride accorded with those instructions but reiterated that it took the gelding a while to get into stride. He further stated that despite the gelding being outpaced on his first start at Salisbury over 7f last month - the gelding has recently been showing increased speed at home so therefore opted to run him over 6f today. Further to this he added that the gelding had failed to get home on either of his previous runs over 7f & 9f which was further reason for the steep drop back in trip. The Jockey was suspended for 12 days for failing to take all reasonable and permissible measures throughout the race in that he failed to ask for neither real or substantial effort over the final 2 1/2f)(op 28/1)"],["2021-10-25","Leicester","794914","2:15","British Stallion Studs EBF Novice Stakes (GBB Race)","Flat","Class 4","","","2yo","","6f","Soft","10","7","5","4","8.5","1","Mega Marvel (GB)","2","C","125","","1:17.13","12/1","Theodore Ladd","Michael Appleby","","\u2013","61","39","Equiano (FR)","Megaleka GB","Misu Bond","North Cheshire Trading Storage Ltd","Chased leaders -
