		Farmer Parmer (Parmie); the farmer
		Old Shep              ; the sheepdog
			
INT: OFFICE - DAY

A young woman is seated at a desk looking puzzlingly at a sloveny dressed man sitting across from her

			VI
		SO..YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE PHARM-

			PARMIE
		YES, THE FARM... I HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH
		SHEEPS...AND GOATS...AND COWS...

Violet stares at Parmer. He stares back. She goes to say something and stops herself.

			PARMIE
		I HAVE A SHEEPDOG.HE IS VERY CLEVER.I SWEAR HE CAN 
		COUNT THE SHEEP. HE KNOWS WHEN THERE IS ONE MISSING.

Violet chews the end of her pen. She looks straight ahead and stares, unblinking.

			PARMIE
		...HE CAN COUNT UP TO TEN

			VI (regaining her posture)
		YES, BUT THIS IS NOT A FARM, IT IS A PHARM..

			PARMIE (interrupting)
		...I SEE! SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

There is an awkward silence. Parmer clears his throat

			PARMIE
		...WOULD IT BE BETTER IF I JUST WENT HOME?

			VI
		I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

			(there is a short silence)

		BEFORE YOU GO...CAN YOUR DOG START WORK ON MON...

			PARMIE (interrupting again)
		YES!

A sheepdog pops his head over the desk and looks towards the camera.

CUT TO:

Violet looks at the camera with her cold, dead eyes and sighs.

FADE OUT:

		Jimmy Jazz (Jazz)        ; the caller

INT: OPEN-PLAN OFFICE – DAY

A wall of cardboard boxes is visible beside the call-centre desks in place 
of a partition. Empty egg cartons are sellotaped to one side to provide sound-proofing.

RADIO JINGLES: [“SIIIIIMPLE ON-LIIIIINE!”]

Fluff licks his lips and presses them against the foam microphone cover.

			FLUFF (in a mid-Atlantic drawl)
WELL HELLO, CALLER ONE! CALLER ONE IS DOWN THE LINE; WHAT’S YOUR NAME AND WHAT’S YOUR PROBLEM CALLER ONE?

Soft, easy-listening 70s rock plays quietly in the background.

			JAZZ (voice on telephone)

Fluff preens himself, smoothing down his hair.

The music cuts to the sound of a needle scratching across a record followed by RADIO JINGLES: [“SIIIIIMPLE ON-LIIIIINE!”]
