he had missed the opportunity to be more handy so dropped to the rail and settled gelding at the rear - as the early pace was strong and mindful that gelding has had respiratory issues previously; he said that he did not want to bustle gelding up and was pleased with the way he settled and travelled going into final bend; it had been his intention to make a move at this point - following eventual winner into the race - but he was prevented from doing so as Sea In The Dark came upsides and put him in a pocket; he added that he was denied a clear run again turning into home straight - a fact which he reported at scales - where he had originally planned to go for a run up the inside rail but after committing to switch around Harbour Vision - that runner had drifted off the rail in front of him. this left him with what he thought was a reducing gap between Harbour Vision which was continuing to edge right-handed and a retreating Reidh - which was why he appeared to hesitate before asking gelding to fully commit for his run approaching final furlong from which point gelding found the line well)(op 50/1)"],["2023-11-06","Wolverhampton (AW)","853956","4:55","Boost Your Acca With BetMGM Handicap (Div II)","Flat","Class 5","","0-70","3yo+","","1m\u00bdf","Standard","11","8","7","6","5.25","0.1","Maid In London (GB)","3","F","9-7","v","1:49.22","9/2","Billy Loughnane","Hugo Palmer","","66","65","32","Roaring Lion (USA)","Maid To Dream GB","Oasis Dream","Tony Oconnor Reins Partners 2","Midfield -
